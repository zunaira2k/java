The company was incorporated on 29 December 1945 in Amalner, India, by Mohamed Premji as Western India Vegetable Products Limited, later abbreviated to Wipro. It was initially set up as a manufacturer of vegetable and refined oils in Amalner, Maharashtra, British India, under the trade names of Kisan, Sunflower, and Camel.[8][9][10]

In 1966, after Mohamed Premji's death, his son Azim Premji took over Wipro as its chairman at the age of 21.[11][12]

During the 1970s and 1975 the company shifted its focus to new opportunities in the IT and computing industry, which was at a nascent stage in India at the time. On 7 June 1977, the name of the company changed from Western India Vegetable Products Limited, to Wipro Products Limited.[9] In 1982, the name was changed again, from Wipro Products Limited to Wipro Limited.[13] Wipro continued to expand in the consumer products domain with the launch of Ralak, a tulsi-based family soap and Wipro Jasmine, a toilet soap.
